Metastatic tumors were established by inoculation of 100,000 GFP-LUC labeled CTCs in 100 µl of PBS into the left cardiac ventricles of 6-8 weeks old female NSG mice supplemented with subcutaneous slow release estrogen pills.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = CTC lines were cultured in ultra-low attachment plates with RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with EGF (20ng/ml), bFGF (20ng/ml), 1X B27 and 1X antibiotic/antimycotic, in 4% O2 and 5% CO2. Metastatic tumors were established by inoculation of 100,000 GFP-LUC labeled CTCs in 100 µl of PBS into the left cardiac ventricles of 6-8 weeks old female NSG mice supplemented with subcutaneous slow release estrogen pills. Metastatic lesions were further dissociated into single-cell suspension by automated dissociation. CTC-derived metastatic cells (GFP+ cells) were sorted for ATAC sequencing.

Metastatic tumors were established by inoculation of 100,000 GFP-LUC labeled CTCs in 100 µl of PBS into the left cardiac ventricles of 6-8 weeks old female NSG mice supplemented with subcutaneous slow release estrogen pills. Metastatic lesions were further dissociated into single-cell suspension by automated dissociation. CTC-derived metastatic cells (GFP+ cells) were sorted for ATAC sequencing.

Metastatic tumors were established by inoculation of 100,000 GFP-LUC labeled CTCs in 100 µl of PBS into the left cardiac ventricles of 6-8 weeks old female NSG mice supplemented with subcutaneous slow release estrogen pills. Metastatic lesions were further dissociated into single-cell suspension by automated dissociation. CTC-derived metastatic cells (GFP+ cells) were sorted for ATAC sequencing.

Metastatic tumors were established by inoculation of 100,000 GFP-LUC labeled CTCs in 100 µl of PBS into the left cardiac ventricles of 6-8 weeks old female NSG mice supplemented with subcutaneous slow release estrogen pills. Metastatic lesions were further dissociated into single-cell suspension by automated dissociation. CTC-derived metastatic cells (GFP+ cells) were sorted for ATAC sequencing.

Metastatic tumors were established by inoculation of 100,000 GFP-LUC labeled CTCs in 100 µl of PBS into the left cardiac ventricles of 6-8 weeks old female NSG mice supplemented with subcutaneous slow release estrogen pills. Metastatic lesions were further dissociated into single-cell suspension by automated dissociation. CTC-derived metastatic cells (GFP+ cells) were sorted for ATAC sequencing.

Metastatic tumors were established by inoculation of 100,000 GFP-LUC labeled CTCs in 100 µl of PBS into the left cardiac ventricles of 6-8 weeks old female NSG mice supplemented with subcutaneous slow release estrogen pills. Metastatic lesions were further dissociated into single-cell suspension by automated dissociation. CTC-derived metastatic cells (GFP+ cells) were sorted for ATAC sequencing.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Transposition reaction was performed by using the Tn5 transposase (Nextera kit) at 37ºC for 30 minutes.
