!Series_summary = Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare neoplasm predominantly affecting children. It occupies a characteristic hybrid position between cancers and inflammatory diseases, which makes it an attractive model for studying cancer development. To explore the molecular mecha-nisms underlying the pathophysiology of LCH and its characteristic clinical heterogeneity, we investi-gated the transcriptomic and epigenomic diversity in primary LCH lesions. Using single-cell RNA se-quencing, we identified multiple recurrent types of LCH cells within these biopsies, including putative LCH progenitor cells and several subsets of differentiated LCH cells. We confirmed the presence of pro-liferative LCH cells in all analysed biopsies using immunohistochemistry, and we defined the epigenomic and gene-regulatory basis of the different LCH cell subsets using chromatin profiling. In summary, our single-cell analysis of LCH uncovered an unexpected degree of cellular, transcriptomic, and epigenomic heterogeneity among LCH cells, reflecting complex developmental hierarchies in LCH lesions.
