!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cut & Run was performed according to the protocol described in Skene, P. J. & Henikoff, S. (2017) with slight modifications. All reactions were performed at 4ºC unless stated otherwise. Each centrifugation step was performed at 600 g for 3 min. 4 x 106 cells was used for each reaction. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in Buffer NE1 (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% Glycerol, Proteinase Inhibitor). After 10 min, cells were collected and incubated in Buffer 1 (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.1% BSA, Proteinase Inhibitor) for 5 min. Cells were collected, washed once with Buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.1% BSA, Proteinase Inhibitor) and resuspended in CUT&RUN Buffer 2. Samples were incubated with antibodies for 2 hours or overnight. Samples containing primary mouse antibodies were washed twice with Buffer 2 before incubation with anti-mouse rb IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 315-005-003) for one hour. Nuclei was then collected, washed twice with Buffer 2 and incubated with pA-MNase fusion protein (150 ng) for one hour. Nuclei was washed once with Buffer 2 and once with low salt buffer (3.5 mM HEPES, Proteinase Inhibitor). Upon resuspension in low salt buffer, 10 mM CaCl2 was added to each reaction. MNase digestion was stopped after 30 min with the addition of Buffer 2 (supplemented with 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM EGTA and 28.8 pg yeast spike in). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 ºC. DNA was purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cut & Run was performed according to the protocol described in Skene, P. J. & Henikoff, S. (2017) with slight modifications. All reactions were performed at 4ºC unless stated otherwise. Each centrifugation step was performed at 600 g for 3 min. 4 x 106 cells was used for each reaction. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in Buffer NE1 (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% Glycerol, Proteinase Inhibitor). After 10 min, cells were collected and incubated in Buffer 1 (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.1% BSA, Proteinase Inhibitor) for 5 min. Cells were collected, washed once with Buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.1% BSA, Proteinase Inhibitor) and resuspended in CUT&RUN Buffer 2. Samples were incubated with antibodies for 2 hours or overnight. Samples containing primary mouse antibodies were washed twice with Buffer 2 before incubation with anti-mouse rb IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 315-005-003) for one hour. Nuclei was then collected, washed twice with Buffer 2 and incubated with pA-MNase fusion protein (150 ng) for one hour. Nuclei was washed once with Buffer 2 and once with low salt buffer (3.5 mM HEPES, Proteinase Inhibitor). Upon resuspension in low salt buffer, 10 mM CaCl2 was added to each reaction. MNase digestion was stopped after 30 min with the addition of Buffer 2 (supplemented with 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM EGTA and 28.8 pg yeast spike in). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 ºC.

After cutting adapters by cutadapt 1.18, reads are then aligned to human genome hg19 and yeast genome sacCer3 from UCSC by bowtie2 separately. Reads from human for each sample are normalized by spike-in yeast reads. MACS2 is used to call peaks under q value < 0.05 with paired-end mode. Peak annotation is performed by using R package ChIPseeker. Chi-Squared test is performed to investigate the peak distribution difference
