Cells were treated with 10 nM E2 every 2 days with media changes, and cell lysates were collected at the following time points: day 10, day 15, day 20, day 25.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Ishikawa ESR1 LBD mutant and wildtype cells were cultured in full media: RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

At least 5 days prior to inductions, cells were placed in hormone deprived media: phenol-red free RPMI-1640 media (Thermo Fisher Scientific), since phenol-red is estrogenic, with 10% charcoal-dextran stripped fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Media was changed 1 day prior to inductions and cells were treated with either DMSO (vehicle) or 10 nM (estradiol) E2 for 8 hours. For prolonged estrogen samples, wildtype cell lines were cultured in phenol-red free RPMI with 10% charcoal-dextran stripped fetal bovine serum and 1% pen-strep for up to 25 days. Cells were treated with 10 nM E2 every 2 days with media changes, and cell lysates were collected at the following time points: day 10, day 15, day 20, day 25.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Ishikawa ESR1 LBD mutant and wildtype cells were cultured in full media: RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for the duration of all experiments. At least 5 days prior to inductions, cells were placed in hormone deprived media: phenol-red free RPMI-1640 media (Thermo Fisher Scientific), since phenol-red is estrogenic, with 10% charcoal-dextran stripped fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Following treatments cells were washed with PBS and harvested with buffer RLT plus (Qiagen) containing 1% beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were passed through a 21-gauge needle and syringe (Sigma-Aldrich) to lyse genomic DNA before RNA was extracted and purified using a Quick RNA Mini Prep kit (Zymo Research).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Using the KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq kit (KAPA Biosystems), poly(A) selected libraries were created with 500 ng of input RNA per sample.
