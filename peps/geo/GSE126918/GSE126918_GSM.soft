!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = LNCaP/AR cell line was generated and maintained as previously described (Chen et al 2003). Cells were cultured at 37° C (5% CO2) in high-glucose RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% HEPES, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% L-Glutamine.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Approximately 10 million 50bp paired-end reads were acquired per replicate condition for sequencing and Poly-A selection was performed.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads with phred quality scores less than 20 and less than 35 bp after trimming were removed from further analysis using trimgalore version 0.4.1.
!Sample_data_processing = Quality-filtered reads were then aligned to the mouse reference genome GRCh38 (hg38) using the HiSAT2 (v 2.0.1) (Pertea et al., 2016) aligner using default settings and marked duplicates using Sambamba version 0.6.6 (Tarasov et al., 2015).

!Sample_data_processing = Differential gene expression analysis was done using the R package DEseq2 (v 1.6.3).
!Sample_data_processing = Read counts were normalized by taking the median of each gene count across samples and dividing each sample gene count by the relative ratio of library sizes between the calculated median and sample size.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = LNCaP/AR cell line was generated and maintained as previously described (Chen et al 2003). Cells were cultured at 37° C (5% CO2) in high-glucose RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% HEPES, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% L-Glutamine.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = LNCaP/AR cell line was generated and maintained as previously described (Chen et al 2003). Cells were cultured at 37° C (5% CO2) in high-glucose RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% HEPES, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% L-Glutamine.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Approximately 10 million 50bp paired-end reads were acquired per replicate condition for sequencing and Poly-A selection was performed.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads with phred quality scores less than 20 and less than 35 bp after trimming were removed from further analysis using trimgalore version 0.4.1.

!Sample_data_processing = Aligned reads were quantified using featurecount (v1.4.6) (Liao et al., 2014) per gene ID against Gencode version 10 (Mudge and Harrow, 2015).
!Sample_data_processing = Differential gene expression analysis was done using the R package DEseq2 (v 1.6.3).
!Sample_data_processing = Read counts were normalized by taking the median of each gene count across samples and dividing each sample gene count by the relative ratio of library sizes between the calculated median and sample size.

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model.

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model.

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model.

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model.

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model.

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model.

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_data_processing = RIGER data matrix of tumor sequencing results: As requested by reviewers, a probabilistic ranking algorithm (used for in vitro screens (RIGER) to our in vivo screen) was adapted to identify true hits. However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library. To use a probabilistic ranking algorithm such as RIGER, the hairpin reads (in the tumors which did not score by week 16) was records as "0" because they failed to enriched quicker than the stochastic enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. This file is the data matrix of tumor reads ready to use by RIGER-E, which has 14 data columns including 13 (reads in tumors, maxi tumor number is 13) + 1 (reads in plasmid).

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Daily gavage treatment with 10mg/kg enzalutamide was initiated on the day of injection. Once tumors were palpable, tumor size was measured weekly by tumor measuring system Peira TM900 (Peira bvba, Belgium).
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = LNCaP/AR cell line was generated and maintained as previously described (Chen et al 2003). Cells were cultured at 37° C (5% CO2) in high-glucose RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% HEPES, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% L-Glutamine. In vivo xenograft experiments were done by subcutaneous injection of 2 × 106 LNCaP/AR cells (100 μl in 50% Matrigel [BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA] and 50% growth media) into the flanks of castrated male SCID mice.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Resistant LNCaP/AR xenograft tumors were harvested and the genomic DNA was isolated by two rounds of phenol extraction using PhaseLock tubes (5prime) followed by isopropanol precipitation.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = All genomic DNAs from tumors, plasmid or pregraft cells were PCR amplified using a protocol previously described (Zuber NBT 2011). Libraries were analyzed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 and 18 nucleotides of the guide strand were sequenced using a custom primer as previously described (Zuber Nature 2011).
