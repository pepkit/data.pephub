!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from the ChIP and input DNAs following standard enzymatic steps consisting of end-polishing, dA-addition, and adaptor ligation. The resulting DNA libraries were quantified and sequenced as 150 bp paired-end reads using Illumina’s HiSeq 2500. The average size of the sequenced fragments were around 380 bp.
!Sample_data_processing = Sequencing reads were aligned to human genome build hg19 with BWA using default parameters (Li 2013).
!Sample_data_processing = Alignments were filtered to extract only reads that belonged to matching pairs; pairs of reads that spanned on the average ~350-400 nt and were in the correct orientation. Read pairs with mapping quality 0 (high quality mappings to multiple locations) were not used for further analysis; in addition, presumptive PCR duplicates and reads that did not pass Illumina’s purity filter were removed.
!Sample_data_processing = Total number of reads was normalized according to the total number of reads that map to the Drosophila dm3 genome from each sample.
