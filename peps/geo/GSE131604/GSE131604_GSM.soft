!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = For ChIP, Cells were treated either with DMSO or with the combination of 100 nM osimertinib and 30nM trametinib for 48h. Cells were trypsinized, and cryopreserved in FBS + 8% DMSO in -80C until processing. For ATAC-seq, cells were treated with DMSO, 100 nM osimertinib or with the combination of 100 nM osimertinib and 30nM trametinib. DMSO-treated control cells were harvested 24h later. Osimertinib and osimertinib/trametinib treated cells were harvested after 2 weeks of treatment. Rebound samples were obtained by withdrawing drugs from three additional osimertinib/trametinib-treated plates and harvesting the cells once the plates reached 60-70% confluence. Cells were trypsinized at timepoints, and cryopreserved in FBS + 8% DMSO in -80C until processing.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For ChIP, Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and crosslinked with 1% Formaldehyde for 10 minutes (H3K27Ac) or crosslinked with two agents startingwith 2 mM DSG (Pierce) for 45 min at RT, followed by 1 ml 1% Formaldehyde for 10 min (YAP and TEAD4). Crosslinked Cell lines were quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min at room temperature. After quenching, the material was resuspended in 1% SDS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 10 mM EDTA) and sonicated for 5 minutes with a Covaris E220 instrument, 5% duty cycle, 140 Peak Incident Power, 200 Cycles per burst, in 1ml AFA Fiber milliTUBEs. Soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of H3K27ac antibody, 7 μg of YAP antibody, 1.5 μg of SLUG antibody, or 1.5 μg of TEAD antibody. 5 µg of chromatin was used for H3K27Ac ChIP, and 40 µg for YAP, TEAD4 and SLUG ChIPs. For ATAC-seq, 50000 cells / sample were resuspended in 1 ml of cold ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (RSB; 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl2 in water). Cells were centrifuged at max speed for 5 min in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. After centrifugation supernatant was carefully aspirated.  Cell pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin by pipetting up and down three times. This cell lysis reaction was incubated on ice for 3 min. After lysis, 1 ml of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 (without NP40 or digitonin) was added, and the tubes were inverted to mix. Nuclei were then centrifuged for 5 min at max speed in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of transposition mix (Corces et al., 2017): 2.5 μl transposase (100 nM final), 16.5 μl PBS, 0.5 μl 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl 10% Tween-20, and 5 μl water) by pipetting up and down six times. Transposition reactions were incubated at 37 C for 30 min in a thermomixer with shaking at 1,000 r.p.m. Reactions were cleaned up with Qiagen columns.

For ATAC-seq, cells were treated with DMSO, 100 nM osimertinib or with the combination of 100 nM osimertinib and 30nM trametinib. DMSO-treated control cells were harvested 24h later. Osimertinib and osimertinib/trametinib treated cells were harvested after 2 weeks of treatment. Rebound samples were obtained by withdrawing drugs from three additional osimertinib/trametinib-treated plates and harvesting the cells once the plates reached 60-70% confluence. Cells were trypsinized at timepoints, and cryopreserved in FBS + 8% DMSO in -80C until processing.

Crosslinked Cell lines were quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min at room temperature. After quenching, the material was resuspended in 1% SDS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 10 mM EDTA) and sonicated for 5 minutes with a Covaris E220 instrument, 5% duty cycle, 140 Peak Incident Power, 200 Cycles per burst, in 1ml AFA Fiber milliTUBEs. Soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of H3K27ac antibody, 7 μg of YAP antibody, 1.5 μg of SLUG antibody, or 1.5 μg of TEAD antibody. 5 µg of chromatin was used for H3K27Ac ChIP, and 40 µg for YAP, TEAD4 and SLUG ChIPs. For ATAC-seq, 50000 cells / sample were resuspended in 1 ml of cold ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (RSB; 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl2 in water). Cells were centrifuged at max speed for 5 min in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. After centrifugation supernatant was carefully aspirated.  Cell pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin by pipetting up and down three times. This cell lysis reaction was incubated on ice for 3 min. After lysis, 1 ml of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 (without NP40 or digitonin) was added, and the tubes were inverted to mix. Nuclei were then centrifuged for 5 min at max speed in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of transposition mix (Corces et al., 2017): 2.5 μl transposase (100 nM final), 16.5 μl PBS, 0.5 μl 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl 10% Tween-20, and 5 μl water) by pipetting up and down six times.

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = For ChIP, Cells were treated either with DMSO or with the combination of 100 nM osimertinib and 30nM trametinib for 48h. Cells were trypsinized, and cryopreserved in FBS + 8% DMSO in -80C until processing. For ATAC-seq, cells were treated with DMSO, 100 nM osimertinib or with the combination of 100 nM osimertinib and 30nM trametinib. DMSO-treated control cells were harvested 24h later. Osimertinib and osimertinib/trametinib treated cells were harvested after 2 weeks of treatment. Rebound samples were obtained by withdrawing drugs from three additional osimertinib/trametinib-treated plates and harvesting the cells once the plates reached 60-70% confluence. Cells were trypsinized at timepoints, and cryopreserved in FBS + 8% DMSO in -80C until processing.

Crosslinked Cell lines were quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min at room temperature. After quenching, the material was resuspended in 1% SDS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 10 mM EDTA) and sonicated for 5 minutes with a Covaris E220 instrument, 5% duty cycle, 140 Peak Incident Power, 200 Cycles per burst, in 1ml AFA Fiber milliTUBEs. Soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of H3K27ac antibody, 7 μg of YAP antibody, 1.5 μg of SLUG antibody, or 1.5 μg of TEAD antibody. 5 µg of chromatin was used for H3K27Ac ChIP, and 40 µg for YAP, TEAD4 and SLUG ChIPs. For ATAC-seq, 50000 cells / sample were resuspended in 1 ml of cold ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (RSB; 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl2 in water). Cells were centrifuged at max speed for 5 min in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. After centrifugation supernatant was carefully aspirated.  Cell pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin by pipetting up and down three times. This cell lysis reaction was incubated on ice for 3 min. After lysis, 1 ml of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 (without NP40 or digitonin) was added, and the tubes were inverted to mix. Nuclei were then centrifuged for 5 min at max speed in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of transposition mix (Corces et al., 2017): 2.5 μl transposase (100 nM final), 16.5 μl PBS, 0.5 μl 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl 10% Tween-20, and 5 μl water) by pipetting up and down six times.

Cells were centrifuged at max speed for 5 min in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. After centrifugation supernatant was carefully aspirated.  Cell pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin by pipetting up and down three times. This cell lysis reaction was incubated on ice for 3 min. After lysis, 1 ml of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 (without NP40 or digitonin) was added, and the tubes were inverted to mix. Nuclei were then centrifuged for 5 min at max speed in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of transposition mix (Corces et al., 2017): 2.5 μl transposase (100 nM final), 16.5 μl PBS, 0.5 μl 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl 10% Tween-20, and 5 μl water) by pipetting up and down six times. Transposition reactions were incubated at 37 C for 30 min in a thermomixer with shaking at 1,000 r.p.m. Reactions were cleaned up with Qiagen columns.

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = For ChIP, Cells were treated either with DMSO or with the combination of 100 nM osimertinib and 30nM trametinib for 48h. Cells were trypsinized, and cryopreserved in FBS + 8% DMSO in -80C until processing. For ATAC-seq, cells were treated with DMSO, 100 nM osimertinib or with the combination of 100 nM osimertinib and 30nM trametinib. DMSO-treated control cells were harvested 24h later. Osimertinib and osimertinib/trametinib treated cells were harvested after 2 weeks of treatment. Rebound samples were obtained by withdrawing drugs from three additional osimertinib/trametinib-treated plates and harvesting the cells once the plates reached 60-70% confluence. Cells were trypsinized at timepoints, and cryopreserved in FBS + 8% DMSO in -80C until processing.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For ChIP, Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and crosslinked with 1% Formaldehyde for 10 minutes (H3K27Ac) or crosslinked with two agents startingwith 2 mM DSG (Pierce) for 45 min at RT, followed by 1 ml 1% Formaldehyde for 10 min (YAP and TEAD4). Crosslinked Cell lines were quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min at room temperature. After quenching, the material was resuspended in 1% SDS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 10 mM EDTA) and sonicated for 5 minutes with a Covaris E220 instrument, 5% duty cycle, 140 Peak Incident Power, 200 Cycles per burst, in 1ml AFA Fiber milliTUBEs. Soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of H3K27ac antibody, 7 μg of YAP antibody, 1.5 μg of SLUG antibody, or 1.5 μg of TEAD antibody. 5 µg of chromatin was used for H3K27Ac ChIP, and 40 µg for YAP, TEAD4 and SLUG ChIPs. For ATAC-seq, 50000 cells / sample were resuspended in 1 ml of cold ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (RSB; 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl2 in water). Cells were centrifuged at max speed for 5 min in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. After centrifugation supernatant was carefully aspirated.  Cell pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin by pipetting up and down three times. This cell lysis reaction was incubated on ice for 3 min. After lysis, 1 ml of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 (without NP40 or digitonin) was added, and the tubes were inverted to mix. Nuclei were then centrifuged for 5 min at max speed in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of transposition mix (Corces et al., 2017): 2.5 μl transposase (100 nM final), 16.5 μl PBS, 0.5 μl 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl 10% Tween-20, and 5 μl water) by pipetting up and down six times.

Cells were trypsinized at timepoints, and cryopreserved in FBS + 8% DMSO in -80C until processing.

Crosslinked Cell lines were quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min at room temperature. After quenching, the material was resuspended in 1% SDS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 10 mM EDTA) and sonicated for 5 minutes with a Covaris E220 instrument, 5% duty cycle, 140 Peak Incident Power, 200 Cycles per burst, in 1ml AFA Fiber milliTUBEs. Soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of H3K27ac antibody, 7 μg of YAP antibody, 1.5 μg of SLUG antibody, or 1.5 μg of TEAD antibody. 5 µg of chromatin was used for H3K27Ac ChIP, and 40 µg for YAP, TEAD4 and SLUG ChIPs. For ATAC-seq, 50000 cells / sample were resuspended in 1 ml of cold ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (RSB; 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl2 in water). Cells were centrifuged at max speed for 5 min in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. After centrifugation supernatant was carefully aspirated.  Cell pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin by pipetting up and down three times. This cell lysis reaction was incubated on ice for 3 min. After lysis, 1 ml of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 (without NP40 or digitonin) was added, and the tubes were inverted to mix. Nuclei were then centrifuged for 5 min at max speed in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of transposition mix (Corces et al., 2017): 2.5 μl transposase (100 nM final), 16.5 μl PBS, 0.5 μl 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl 10% Tween-20, and 5 μl water) by pipetting up and down six times.

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = PC-9 were harvested and 5 x 106 cells with 50% Matrigel (Fisher Scientific) were implanted subcutaneously in the right flank of the NCr nude mice. Tumors were allowed to establish to 200 ± 50 mm3 in size before randomization using Studylog software (San Francisco, CA) into treatment groups (3 mice / group). Osimertinib (10 mg/kg once daily) was administered orally as a suspension using 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Mice were treated for 21 days, after which the tumors were harvested.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Single cell isolation form tumors: Fresh tumor specimens (n=3) were pooled and minced in a 15 mL conical tube with media (DMEM + 10% FBS), penicillin–streptomycin (Fisher Scientific), 100 U/mL collagenase type IV (Life Technologies) and 2.5 mg/mL DNAse I (Sigma Aldrich), then incubated for 45min at 37°C.  Single cell suspensions were isolated by straining through a 40μm filters.  Cells were incubated with  Zombie Green™ Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend), blocked with Human TruStain FcX™ (BioLegend), and stained with human anti-EpCAM (clone 9C4).  Viable EpCAM+ tumor cells were isolated via FACS Melody instrument (BD Biosciences). Cells were loaded onto a 10X Chromium instrument (10X Genomics) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
