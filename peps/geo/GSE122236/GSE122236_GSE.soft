!Series_summary = We identified that downregulation of RNF20/H2Bub1 is involved in HGSOC progression through altering key immune signaling pathways.
!Series_summary = The goal of ATAC-seq analysis was to profile chromatin conformation in FTSEC cells (FT190 and FT194 cell lines) with RNF20 knockdown (shRNF20) or control shRNA. The data generated by ATAC-Seq was integrated with RNA-seq data analysis for the same samples.
!Series_overall_design = Chromatin conformation profiles of FT190 and FT194 shRNF20 (RNF20 knockdown) or control shRNA cells were generated by using Illumina HiSeq 2500, in triplicates.
