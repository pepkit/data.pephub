!Sample_data_processing = Peak locations for BRD4 and H3K27 ChIP experiments were determined using the MACS -1.4.2 with a cutoff p-value of 1E-7 for narrow peaks and 1E-1 for broad peaks

!Sample_data_processing = ChIP-seq reads from samples 1 and 2 were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) using the bwa-0.6.1 with default parameters. Aligned and unaligned reads and their quality strings are contained in resulting bam files. Therefore, bam files are provided as raw data

!Sample_data_processing = Peak locations for BRD4 and H3K27 ChIP experiments were determined using the MACS -1.4.2 with a cutoff p-value of 1E-7 for narrow peaks and 1E-1 for broad peaks

!Sample_data_processing = ChIP peak regions from multiple samples (of the same ChIP type) were merged, and aligned reads for these newly defined regions were caluclated (even for those where no peak was called). Then the resulting regions were annotated with gene information by calculating distances from RefSeq gene starts and ends to the center of the newly defined peak regions.

!Sample_data_processing = ChIP-seq reads from samples 1 and 2 were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) using the bwa-0.6.1 with default parameters. Aligned and unaligned reads and their quality strings are contained in resulting bam files. Therefore, bam files are provided as raw data

!Sample_data_processing = Peak locations for BRD4 and H3K27 ChIP experiments were determined using the MACS -1.4.2 with a cutoff p-value of 1E-7 for narrow peaks and 1E-1 for broad peaks
!Sample_data_processing = Enriched regions for Pol2 ChIP experiments were identified using the SICER algorithm with a cutoff FDR of 1E-10 and gap parameter of 600bp
!Sample_data_processing = ChIP peak regions from multiple samples (of the same ChIP type) were merged, and aligned reads for these newly defined regions were caluclated (even for those where no peak was called). Then the resulting regions were annotated with gene information by calculating distances from RefSeq gene starts and ends to the center of the newly defined peak regions.
!Sample_data_processing = ATAC-seq reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) using the Bowtie2-2.2.6 with maximum fragment length of 1000 and no-mixed mode. Duplicates marked with Picard-1.140.
