!Sample_data_processing = Basecalls were performed using Illumina RTA 1.18.64, and fastq files were then generated using Illumina bcl2fastq v2.17.1.14
!Sample_data_processing = Each 50-bp read from each pair was aligned, independently of its mate, to the hg18 reference genome using bowtie2 version 2.3.0 with the following parameters: --end-to-end --very-sensitive -L 30 --score-min L,-0.6,-0.2 --mp 6,2. Reads aligned to unique genomic locations were retained for subsequent analysis. Reads aligned to more than one location were discarded. Reads that could not be aligned were split at putative ligation junctions and the resulting parts were re-submitted to bowtie2 for alignment. If one or more parts were uniquely aligned, they were retained for subsequent analysis, otherwise a final attempt to align the read in question was carried out by applying the iterative mapping procedure of Imakaev et al (Imakaev 2012). Specifically, the read was iteratively trimmed in increments of 5 bases at its 3ʹ end and then submitted to bowtie2 at each iteration until a unique or multiple alignment was found. If the alignment was unique, the read was retained for subsequent analysis, otherwise it was discarded. To improved the yield of aligned reads, we carried out this iterative alignment procedure also by trimming the 5ʹ end of the read in question. Next, the reads and read parts that were uniquely aligned were combined into pairs based on the original unaligned read pair from which the aligned reads or parts were derived. Uniquely aligned reads or parts lacking a uniquely aligned mate were discarded because they cannot be used to count contacts. Uniquely aligned read pairs were sorted by genomic location of the upstream read and then by genomic location of the downstream read. Any aligned read pairs with genomic locations and strand orientations identical to those of another aligned pair were discarded as likely PCR artifacts. The remaining aligned pairs were then pooled from two different biological replicates for each treatment (-E2 and +E2), without removing duplicate pairs. The pooled pairs pairs were filtered to remove dangling ends and self-ligation products, as described by Jin F et al (Jin 2013). In particular, based on histograms of inter-read separation for each type of read pair, we found it adequate to discard both “samestrand” and “outward” pairs having inter-read separation less than 1 kb.
!Sample_data_processing = The retained pairs of aligned reads were used to construct a matrix of binned contact counts for each chromosome. Each pair of reads aligned to the same chromosome was used to increment the integer value at row i and column j, as well as row j and column i, of a matrix of contact counts for that chromosome, where i = floor(u/b) and j = floor(d/b), b is the genomic bin size, and u and d > u are the genomic locations of the midpoints of the restriction fragments overlapping the upstream and downstream reads in the pair, respectively. Contact count matrices were constructed using genomic bins of sizes of 20 kb, to identify contact domain boundaries, 250 kb, to generate A/B compartment profiles, and 500 kb, to generate heat maps representing low-resolution intra-chromosomal contacts. To omit genomic regions with excessively low numbers of mapped reads, matrix rows and columns having too many zero entries were discarded. The minimum number of non-zero entries required to retain a row was half of the median number of non-zero entries in all rows. Binned contact count matrices for each chromosome were individually un-biased using the iterative correction method of Imakaev et al. (Imakaev 2012). To obtain local mean and standard deviation of contact counts as functions of genomic inter-locus distance, we calculated mean and standard deviation along the upper diagonals of each un-biased contact count matrix. For each bin of the contact count matrix corresponding to the interaction between loci i and j, we calculated the z-score z(i,j) = [C(i,j) − m(d(i,j))] / s(d(i,j)), where C(i,j) is the un-biased contact count for the bin in question, d(i,j) is the genomic distance between loci i and j, and m(d(i,j)) and s(d(i,j)) are the local mean and standard deviation of un-biased contact counts for inter-locus distance d(i,j). A sliding window of 20 Mb was used to calculate m(d(i,j)) and s(d(i,j)).
!Sample_data_processing = To obtain profiles of A/B compartments over each chromosome, we applied a previously described procedure (Imakaev 2012, Barutcu 2015) with minor modifications. Specifically, the matrix of z-scores with bins of size 250 kb was edited by zeroing out the main diagonal as well as the diagonals immediately above and below the main diagonal. A Pearson correlation matrix was then calculated from the edited matrix of z-scores. The resulting correlation matrix was subjected to principal component analysis by first calculating the covariance matrix and then obtaining the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue from such covariance matrix. The sign of this eigenvector was adjusted to yield a positive sign for the covariance between that eigenvector and a vector containing the GC content fractions in genomic bins matching those in the eigenvector. After this sign adjustment, positive eigenvector components correspond to A-compartment regions whereas negative components correspond to B-compartment regions.
!Sample_data_processing = To determine locations and intensities of boundaries between contact domains, we applied a method based on the calculation of  “insulation score” (Crane 2015). The insulation score was obtained by summing contact counts within a square region of side 25 bins, while sliding such region along the diagonal of the un-biased contact count matrix with bins of size 20 kb. The resulting sums were divided by their average value over the chromosome of interest. To identify boundaries of contact domains we applied a numerical procedure for finding local minima. Specifically, the derivative of the insulation score was estimated from the slope of a linear fit over a sliding window of 7 bins. Next, the zero-crossings of the estimated derivative as a function of bin index were used to identify local minima and local maxima of the insulation score. To omit weak or spurious boundaries, at each local minimum we calculated the peak-to-peak value as the larger of the two differences between the insulation score at the local minimum and the insulation scores at the preceding and following local maxima. A domain boundary was called if the corresponding local minimum had a peak-to-peak value greater than 25% of the median peak-to-peak value observed over the chromosome of interest.

!Sample_data_processing = Each 50-bp read from each pair was aligned, independently of its mate, to the hg18 reference genome using bowtie2 version 2.3.0 with the following parameters: --end-to-end --very-sensitive -L 30 --score-min L,-0.6,-0.2 --mp 6,2. Reads aligned to unique genomic locations were retained for subsequent analysis. Reads aligned to more than one location were discarded. Reads that could not be aligned were split at putative ligation junctions and the resulting parts were re-submitted to bowtie2 for alignment. If one or more parts were uniquely aligned, they were retained for subsequent analysis, otherwise a final attempt to align the read in question was carried out by applying the iterative mapping procedure of Imakaev et al (Imakaev 2012). Specifically, the read was iteratively trimmed in increments of 5 bases at its 3ʹ end and then submitted to bowtie2 at each iteration until a unique or multiple alignment was found. If the alignment was unique, the read was retained for subsequent analysis, otherwise it was discarded. To improved the yield of aligned reads, we carried out this iterative alignment procedure also by trimming the 5ʹ end of the read in question. Next, the reads and read parts that were uniquely aligned were combined into pairs based on the original unaligned read pair from which the aligned reads or parts were derived. Uniquely aligned reads or parts lacking a uniquely aligned mate were discarded because they cannot be used to count contacts. Uniquely aligned read pairs were sorted by genomic location of the upstream read and then by genomic location of the downstream read. Any aligned read pairs with genomic locations and strand orientations identical to those of another aligned pair were discarded as likely PCR artifacts. The remaining aligned pairs were then pooled from two different biological replicates for each treatment (-E2 and +E2), without removing duplicate pairs. The pooled pairs pairs were filtered to remove dangling ends and self-ligation products, as described by Jin F et al (Jin 2013). In particular, based on histograms of inter-read separation for each type of read pair, we found it adequate to discard both “samestrand” and “outward” pairs having inter-read separation less than 1 kb.
!Sample_data_processing = The retained pairs of aligned reads were used to construct a matrix of binned contact counts for each chromosome. Each pair of reads aligned to the same chromosome was used to increment the integer value at row i and column j, as well as row j and column i, of a matrix of contact counts for that chromosome, where i = floor(u/b) and j = floor(d/b), b is the genomic bin size, and u and d > u are the genomic locations of the midpoints of the restriction fragments overlapping the upstream and downstream reads in the pair, respectively. Contact count matrices were constructed using genomic bins of sizes of 20 kb, to identify contact domain boundaries, 250 kb, to generate A/B compartment profiles, and 500 kb, to generate heat maps representing low-resolution intra-chromosomal contacts. To omit genomic regions with excessively low numbers of mapped reads, matrix rows and columns having too many zero entries were discarded. The minimum number of non-zero entries required to retain a row was half of the median number of non-zero entries in all rows. Binned contact count matrices for each chromosome were individually un-biased using the iterative correction method of Imakaev et al. (Imakaev 2012). To obtain local mean and standard deviation of contact counts as functions of genomic inter-locus distance, we calculated mean and standard deviation along the upper diagonals of each un-biased contact count matrix. For each bin of the contact count matrix corresponding to the interaction between loci i and j, we calculated the z-score z(i,j) = [C(i,j) − m(d(i,j))] / s(d(i,j)), where C(i,j) is the un-biased contact count for the bin in question, d(i,j) is the genomic distance between loci i and j, and m(d(i,j)) and s(d(i,j)) are the local mean and standard deviation of un-biased contact counts for inter-locus distance d(i,j). A sliding window of 20 Mb was used to calculate m(d(i,j)) and s(d(i,j)).
!Sample_data_processing = To obtain profiles of A/B compartments over each chromosome, we applied a previously described procedure (Imakaev 2012, Barutcu 2015) with minor modifications. Specifically, the matrix of z-scores with bins of size 250 kb was edited by zeroing out the main diagonal as well as the diagonals immediately above and below the main diagonal. A Pearson correlation matrix was then calculated from the edited matrix of z-scores. The resulting correlation matrix was subjected to principal component analysis by first calculating the covariance matrix and then obtaining the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue from such covariance matrix. The sign of this eigenvector was adjusted to yield a positive sign for the covariance between that eigenvector and a vector containing the GC content fractions in genomic bins matching those in the eigenvector. After this sign adjustment, positive eigenvector components correspond to A-compartment regions whereas negative components correspond to B-compartment regions.
!Sample_data_processing = To determine locations and intensities of boundaries between contact domains, we applied a method based on the calculation of  “insulation score” (Crane 2015). The insulation score was obtained by summing contact counts within a square region of side 25 bins, while sliding such region along the diagonal of the un-biased contact count matrix with bins of size 20 kb. The resulting sums were divided by their average value over the chromosome of interest. To identify boundaries of contact domains we applied a numerical procedure for finding local minima. Specifically, the derivative of the insulation score was estimated from the slope of a linear fit over a sliding window of 7 bins. Next, the zero-crossings of the estimated derivative as a function of bin index were used to identify local minima and local maxima of the insulation score. To omit weak or spurious boundaries, at each local minimum we calculated the peak-to-peak value as the larger of the two differences between the insulation score at the local minimum and the insulation scores at the preceding and following local maxima. A domain boundary was called if the corresponding local minimum had a peak-to-peak value greater than 25% of the median peak-to-peak value observed over the chromosome of interest.

!Sample_data_processing = Each 50-bp read from each pair was aligned, independently of its mate, to the hg18 reference genome using bowtie2 version 2.3.0 with the following parameters: --end-to-end --very-sensitive -L 30 --score-min L,-0.6,-0.2 --mp 6,2. Reads aligned to unique genomic locations were retained for subsequent analysis. Reads aligned to more than one location were discarded. Reads that could not be aligned were split at putative ligation junctions and the resulting parts were re-submitted to bowtie2 for alignment. If one or more parts were uniquely aligned, they were retained for subsequent analysis, otherwise a final attempt to align the read in question was carried out by applying the iterative mapping procedure of Imakaev et al (Imakaev 2012). Specifically, the read was iteratively trimmed in increments of 5 bases at its 3ʹ end and then submitted to bowtie2 at each iteration until a unique or multiple alignment was found. If the alignment was unique, the read was retained for subsequent analysis, otherwise it was discarded. To improved the yield of aligned reads, we carried out this iterative alignment procedure also by trimming the 5ʹ end of the read in question. Next, the reads and read parts that were uniquely aligned were combined into pairs based on the original unaligned read pair from which the aligned reads or parts were derived. Uniquely aligned reads or parts lacking a uniquely aligned mate were discarded because they cannot be used to count contacts. Uniquely aligned read pairs were sorted by genomic location of the upstream read and then by genomic location of the downstream read. Any aligned read pairs with genomic locations and strand orientations identical to those of another aligned pair were discarded as likely PCR artifacts. The remaining aligned pairs were then pooled from two different biological replicates for each treatment (-E2 and +E2), without removing duplicate pairs. The pooled pairs pairs were filtered to remove dangling ends and self-ligation products, as described by Jin F et al (Jin 2013). In particular, based on histograms of inter-read separation for each type of read pair, we found it adequate to discard both “samestrand” and “outward” pairs having inter-read separation less than 1 kb.
!Sample_data_processing = The retained pairs of aligned reads were used to construct a matrix of binned contact counts for each chromosome. Each pair of reads aligned to the same chromosome was used to increment the integer value at row i and column j, as well as row j and column i, of a matrix of contact counts for that chromosome, where i = floor(u/b) and j = floor(d/b), b is the genomic bin size, and u and d > u are the genomic locations of the midpoints of the restriction fragments overlapping the upstream and downstream reads in the pair, respectively. Contact count matrices were constructed using genomic bins of sizes of 20 kb, to identify contact domain boundaries, 250 kb, to generate A/B compartment profiles, and 500 kb, to generate heat maps representing low-resolution intra-chromosomal contacts. To omit genomic regions with excessively low numbers of mapped reads, matrix rows and columns having too many zero entries were discarded. The minimum number of non-zero entries required to retain a row was half of the median number of non-zero entries in all rows. Binned contact count matrices for each chromosome were individually un-biased using the iterative correction method of Imakaev et al. (Imakaev 2012). To obtain local mean and standard deviation of contact counts as functions of genomic inter-locus distance, we calculated mean and standard deviation along the upper diagonals of each un-biased contact count matrix. For each bin of the contact count matrix corresponding to the interaction between loci i and j, we calculated the z-score z(i,j) = [C(i,j) − m(d(i,j))] / s(d(i,j)), where C(i,j) is the un-biased contact count for the bin in question, d(i,j) is the genomic distance between loci i and j, and m(d(i,j)) and s(d(i,j)) are the local mean and standard deviation of un-biased contact counts for inter-locus distance d(i,j). A sliding window of 20 Mb was used to calculate m(d(i,j)) and s(d(i,j)).
!Sample_data_processing = To obtain profiles of A/B compartments over each chromosome, we applied a previously described procedure (Imakaev 2012, Barutcu 2015) with minor modifications. Specifically, the matrix of z-scores with bins of size 250 kb was edited by zeroing out the main diagonal as well as the diagonals immediately above and below the main diagonal. A Pearson correlation matrix was then calculated from the edited matrix of z-scores. The resulting correlation matrix was subjected to principal component analysis by first calculating the covariance matrix and then obtaining the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue from such covariance matrix. The sign of this eigenvector was adjusted to yield a positive sign for the covariance between that eigenvector and a vector containing the GC content fractions in genomic bins matching those in the eigenvector. After this sign adjustment, positive eigenvector components correspond to A-compartment regions whereas negative components correspond to B-compartment regions.
!Sample_data_processing = To determine locations and intensities of boundaries between contact domains, we applied a method based on the calculation of  “insulation score” (Crane 2015). The insulation score was obtained by summing contact counts within a square region of side 25 bins, while sliding such region along the diagonal of the un-biased contact count matrix with bins of size 20 kb. The resulting sums were divided by their average value over the chromosome of interest. To identify boundaries of contact domains we applied a numerical procedure for finding local minima. Specifically, the derivative of the insulation score was estimated from the slope of a linear fit over a sliding window of 7 bins. Next, the zero-crossings of the estimated derivative as a function of bin index were used to identify local minima and local maxima of the insulation score. To omit weak or spurious boundaries, at each local minimum we calculated the peak-to-peak value as the larger of the two differences between the insulation score at the local minimum and the insulation scores at the preceding and following local maxima. A domain boundary was called if the corresponding local minimum had a peak-to-peak value greater than 25% of the median peak-to-peak value observed over the chromosome of interest.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = GRO-seq experiments were performed as previously reported (Li et al., 2013). Briefly, MCF7 cells were swollen in swelling buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH7.5, 2mM MgCl2, 3mM CaCl2) for 5 min on ice and then lysed in lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 0.5% IGEPAL and 10% glycerol), before being re-suspended in 100µl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA). For the run-on assay, re-suspended nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 300mM KCl, 20 units of Superase.In, 1% sarkosyl, 500µM ATP, GTP, and Br-UTP, 2µM CTP) and incubated for 5 min at 300C. The nuclear-run-on RNA (NRO-RNA) was then extracted with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. After base hydrolysis on ice for 40min and followed by treatment with DNase I and antarctic phosphatase, the Br-UTP labeled NRO-RNA was purified by an anti-BrdU argarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech) in binding buffer (0.5XSSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% tween) for 3hr at 4°C while rotating. Then T4 PNK (NEB) was used to repair the end of NRO-RNA. Subsequently, cDNA synthesis was performed as reported(9,33) with few modifications. The RNA fragments were subjected to poly-A tailing reaction by poly-A polymerase (NEB) for 30 min at 37°C. Reverse transcription was then performed using superscript III (Invitrogen) with oNTI223 primer. The cDNA products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel with right product (~100-500bp) being excised and recovered by gel extraction. After that, the first-strand cDNA was circularized by CircLigase (Epicentre) and re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB). Re-linearized single strand cDNA were separated by TBE gel and the products of desired size was excised (~120-320bp) for gel extraction. Finally, cDNA template was amplified by PCR using the Phusion High-Fidelity enzyme (NEB) with primers oNTI200 and oNTI201 for deep sequencing.

The resultant nuclei were washed once again with 10 ml lysis buffer and then re-suspended in 100μl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = GRO-seq experiments were performed as previously reported (Li et al., 2013). Briefly, MCF7 cells were swollen in swelling buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH7.5, 2mM MgCl2, 3mM CaCl2) for 5 min on ice and then lysed in lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 0.5% IGEPAL and 10% glycerol), before being re-suspended in 100µl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA). For the run-on assay, re-suspended nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 300mM KCl, 20 units of Superase.In, 1% sarkosyl, 500µM ATP, GTP, and Br-UTP, 2µM CTP) and incubated for 5 min at 300C. The nuclear-run-on RNA (NRO-RNA) was then extracted with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. After base hydrolysis on ice for 40min and followed by treatment with DNase I and antarctic phosphatase, the Br-UTP labeled NRO-RNA was purified by an anti-BrdU argarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech) in binding buffer (0.5XSSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% tween) for 3hr at 4°C while rotating. Then T4 PNK (NEB) was used to repair the end of NRO-RNA. Subsequently, cDNA synthesis was performed as reported(9,33) with few modifications. The RNA fragments were subjected to poly-A tailing reaction by poly-A polymerase (NEB) for 30 min at 37°C. Reverse transcription was then performed using superscript III (Invitrogen) with oNTI223 primer. The cDNA products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel with right product (~100-500bp) being excised and recovered by gel extraction. After that, the first-strand cDNA was circularized by CircLigase (Epicentre) and re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB). Re-linearized single strand cDNA were separated by TBE gel and the products of desired size was excised (~120-320bp) for gel extraction. Finally, cDNA template was amplified by PCR using the Phusion High-Fidelity enzyme (NEB) with primers oNTI200 and oNTI201 for deep sequencing.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 0.5% IGEPAL and 10% glycerol). The resultant nuclei were washed once again with 10 ml lysis buffer and then re-suspended in 100μl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = GRO-seq experiments were performed as previously reported (Li et al., 2013). Briefly, MCF7 cells were swollen in swelling buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH7.5, 2mM MgCl2, 3mM CaCl2) for 5 min on ice and then lysed in lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 0.5% IGEPAL and 10% glycerol), before being re-suspended in 100µl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA). For the run-on assay, re-suspended nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 300mM KCl, 20 units of Superase.In, 1% sarkosyl, 500µM ATP, GTP, and Br-UTP, 2µM CTP) and incubated for 5 min at 300C. The nuclear-run-on RNA (NRO-RNA) was then extracted with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. After base hydrolysis on ice for 40min and followed by treatment with DNase I and antarctic phosphatase, the Br-UTP labeled NRO-RNA was purified by an anti-BrdU argarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech) in binding buffer (0.5XSSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% tween) for 3hr at 4°C while rotating. Then T4 PNK (NEB) was used to repair the end of NRO-RNA. Subsequently, cDNA synthesis was performed as reported(9,33) with few modifications. The RNA fragments were subjected to poly-A tailing reaction by poly-A polymerase (NEB) for 30 min at 37°C. Reverse transcription was then performed using superscript III (Invitrogen) with oNTI223 primer. The cDNA products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel with right product (~100-500bp) being excised and recovered by gel extraction. After that, the first-strand cDNA was circularized by CircLigase (Epicentre) and re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB). Re-linearized single strand cDNA were separated by TBE gel and the products of desired size was excised (~120-320bp) for gel extraction. Finally, cDNA template was amplified by PCR using the Phusion High-Fidelity enzyme (NEB) with primers oNTI200 and oNTI201 for deep sequencing.

EdgeR was used to compute the significance of the differential gene expression (FC ≥ 1.5, FDR ≤ 0.01). Additionally, a read density threshold (that is, normalized GRO-seq read counts per kb) was used to exclude lowly expressed genes.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 0.5% IGEPAL and 10% glycerol). The resultant nuclei were washed once again with 10 ml lysis buffer and then re-suspended in 100μl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = GRO-seq experiments were performed as previously reported (Li et al., 2013). Briefly, MCF7 cells were swollen in swelling buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH7.5, 2mM MgCl2, 3mM CaCl2) for 5 min on ice and then lysed in lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 0.5% IGEPAL and 10% glycerol), before being re-suspended in 100µl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA). For the run-on assay, re-suspended nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 300mM KCl, 20 units of Superase.In, 1% sarkosyl, 500µM ATP, GTP, and Br-UTP, 2µM CTP) and incubated for 5 min at 300C. The nuclear-run-on RNA (NRO-RNA) was then extracted with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. After base hydrolysis on ice for 40min and followed by treatment with DNase I and antarctic phosphatase, the Br-UTP labeled NRO-RNA was purified by an anti-BrdU argarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech) in binding buffer (0.5XSSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% tween) for 3hr at 4°C while rotating. Then T4 PNK (NEB) was used to repair the end of NRO-RNA. Subsequently, cDNA synthesis was performed as reported(9,33) with few modifications. The RNA fragments were subjected to poly-A tailing reaction by poly-A polymerase (NEB) for 30 min at 37°C. Reverse transcription was then performed using superscript III (Invitrogen) with oNTI223 primer. The cDNA products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel with right product (~100-500bp) being excised and recovered by gel extraction. After that, the first-strand cDNA was circularized by CircLigase (Epicentre) and re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB). Re-linearized single strand cDNA were separated by TBE gel and the products of desired size was excised (~120-320bp) for gel extraction. Finally, cDNA template was amplified by PCR using the Phusion High-Fidelity enzyme (NEB) with primers oNTI200 and oNTI201 for deep sequencing.

The resultant nuclei were washed once again with 10 ml lysis buffer and then re-suspended in 100μl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = GRO-seq experiments were performed as previously reported (Li et al., 2013). Briefly, MCF7 cells were swollen in swelling buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH7.5, 2mM MgCl2, 3mM CaCl2) for 5 min on ice and then lysed in lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 0.5% IGEPAL and 10% glycerol), before being re-suspended in 100µl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA). For the run-on assay, re-suspended nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 300mM KCl, 20 units of Superase.In, 1% sarkosyl, 500µM ATP, GTP, and Br-UTP, 2µM CTP) and incubated for 5 min at 300C. The nuclear-run-on RNA (NRO-RNA) was then extracted with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. After base hydrolysis on ice for 40min and followed by treatment with DNase I and antarctic phosphatase, the Br-UTP labeled NRO-RNA was purified by an anti-BrdU argarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech) in binding buffer (0.5XSSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% tween) for 3hr at 4°C while rotating. Then T4 PNK (NEB) was used to repair the end of NRO-RNA. Subsequently, cDNA synthesis was performed as reported(9,33) with few modifications. The RNA fragments were subjected to poly-A tailing reaction by poly-A polymerase (NEB) for 30 min at 37°C. Reverse transcription was then performed using superscript III (Invitrogen) with oNTI223 primer. The cDNA products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel with right product (~100-500bp) being excised and recovered by gel extraction. After that, the first-strand cDNA was circularized by CircLigase (Epicentre) and re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB). Re-linearized single strand cDNA were separated by TBE gel and the products of desired size was excised (~120-320bp) for gel extraction. Finally, cDNA template was amplified by PCR using the Phusion High-Fidelity enzyme (NEB) with primers oNTI200 and oNTI201 for deep sequencing.

The resultant nuclei were washed once again with 10 ml lysis buffer and then re-suspended in 100μl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = GRO-seq experiments were performed as previously reported (Li et al., 2013). Briefly, MCF7 cells were swollen in swelling buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH7.5, 2mM MgCl2, 3mM CaCl2) for 5 min on ice and then lysed in lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 0.5% IGEPAL and 10% glycerol), before being re-suspended in 100µl of freezing buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH8.3, 40% glycerol, 5mM MgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA). For the run-on assay, re-suspended nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 300mM KCl, 20 units of Superase.In, 1% sarkosyl, 500µM ATP, GTP, and Br-UTP, 2µM CTP) and incubated for 5 min at 300C. The nuclear-run-on RNA (NRO-RNA) was then extracted with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. After base hydrolysis on ice for 40min and followed by treatment with DNase I and antarctic phosphatase, the Br-UTP labeled NRO-RNA was purified by an anti-BrdU argarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech) in binding buffer (0.5XSSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% tween) for 3hr at 4°C while rotating. Then T4 PNK (NEB) was used to repair the end of NRO-RNA. Subsequently, cDNA synthesis was performed as reported(9,33) with few modifications. The RNA fragments were subjected to poly-A tailing reaction by poly-A polymerase (NEB) for 30 min at 37°C. Reverse transcription was then performed using superscript III (Invitrogen) with oNTI223 primer. The cDNA products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel with right product (~100-500bp) being excised and recovered by gel extraction. After that, the first-strand cDNA was circularized by CircLigase (Epicentre) and re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB). Re-linearized single strand cDNA were separated by TBE gel and the products of desired size was excised (~120-320bp) for gel extraction. Finally, cDNA template was amplified by PCR using the Phusion High-Fidelity enzyme (NEB) with primers oNTI200 and oNTI201 for deep sequencing.

!Sample_data_processing = Basecalls performed using CASAVA version 1.4, then all Raw fastq files are treated with prinseq-lite.pl to remove PCR amplification duplicates.
!Sample_data_processing = Then the remaining reads are trimmered 6 bp from the 5' end and keep 40bp for each reads for the mapping.
!Sample_data_processing = After that, all reads are mapped to the hg19 genome with bowtie ( -q --offrate 6 -m 1 --best --strata -t -v 3 --sam)
!Sample_data_processing = The common artifacts derived from clonal amplification were circumvented by considering maximal three tags from each unique genomic position as determined from the mapping data. To determine transcription changes in gene body, the sequencing reads for RefSeq genes were counted over the first 13kb of the entire gene body, excluding the 500bp promoter-proximal region on the sense strand with respect to the gene orientation by using HOMER. EdgeR was used to compute the significance of the differential gene expression (FC ≥ 1.5, FDR ≤ 0.01). Additionally, a read density threshold (that is, normalized GRO-seq read counts per kb) was used to exclude lowly expressed genes.
