Briefly, cell samples were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, and quenched by glycine to a 125nM final concentration.BAF155 and BRG1 ChIP-seq were performed as previously described by Kadoch and colleagues17. BAF155-2 (Santa Cruz, SC-9746) and BRG1-2 (Abcam, ab110641) were performed as described by Roberts and colleagues as detailed in the methods section.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The fixed cells were lysed in SDS buffer and the chromatin was sheared by Covaris sonication. The sheared chromatin was incubated with the aforementioned antibodies and protein G-Dynabeads. The samples underwent decrosslinking, RNase and proteinase K treatment.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = DNA fragments were eluted using AMP Pure beads, library was prepared and samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing using HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina).
