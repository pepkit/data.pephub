GBM neurosphere cell lines GSC23 and TS576 were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, #11320-033) supplemented with B27 supplement (Gibco, #12504-044) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and grown in suspension.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Approximately 50,000 nuclei were resuspended in 20µL ice-cold Tagmentation Buffer, and incubated with 1µL Tagmentation enzyme (Illumina, #FC-121-1030) at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking 500 rpm. The tagmentated DNA was purified using MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, #28004).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = libraries were amplified using NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB, #M0541) with primer extension at 72°C for 5 min, denaturation at 98°C for 30s, followed by 8 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 10s, annealing at 63°C for 30s and extension at 72°C for 60s. Amplified libraries were then purified using MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, #28004), and two size selection steps were performed using SPRIselect bead (Beckman Coulter, #B23317) at 0.55X and 1.5X bead-to-sample volume rations, respectively. Each library was then sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 or HiSeq4000 to a depth of >= 20 million usable reads pairs
!Sample_data_processing = Nextera adapters were trimmed from the raw fastq files by using cutadapt with parameters “-m 5 -e 0.10 -a CTGTCTCTTATA -A CTGTCTCTTATA” and then aligned to human reference genome hg38 using bowtie2 with parameters “-X2000 --mm --local”
!Sample_data_processing = Improper mapped, poorly mapped and unmatched reads were filtered from the resultant raw bam files using samtools view with parameters “-F 1804 -f 2 -q30”
!Sample_data_processing = Duplicates were marked by “picard MarkDuplicate” and removed by “samtools view”
!Sample_data_processing = Final bam files were generated after removing mitochondrial reads by “awk” command
!Sample_data_processing = Replicate Bam files were merged using “samtools merge” and converted to tagAlign format using bedtools bamtobed with parameters “-bedpe -mate1 -I” and “awk”
!Sample_data_processing = To account for the cutting offset of Tn5 transposase, mapping position was shifted using “awk”

!Sample_data_processing = Bedgraph files output from MACS2 were converted to BigWig files using bedGraphToBigWig
!Sample_data_processing = NarrowPeak files from individual ATAC-seq replicates and pooled peak files from MACS2 were sorted for high P-value peaks (>= 13 -log10 [p < 0.05]) with “awk”
!Sample_data_processing = high P-value pooled peaks were intersected with high P-value peaks from each replicate using bedtools intersect with the -u parameter
!Sample_data_processing = In order to exclude promoter proximal peaks the Gencode hg38 annotation was downloaded and TSS +/- 2kb were filtered out with “awk”. High p-value peaks were intersected with the Gencode TSS annotation with bedtools intersect with the -v parameter
!Sample_data_processing = Promoter distal high p-value ATAC peaks were intersected with H3K27Ac ChIP-seq peaks from each specific cell line to identify ATAC peaks located within regions of H3K27Ac using bedtools intersect with the -wa parameter.
!Sample_data_processing = Motifs were identified from these peaks using HOMER findMotifsGenome with the parameter “-size given”
!Sample_data_processing = Genome_build: hg38
!Sample_data_processing = Supplementary_files_format_and_content: BigWig (bw) files contain IGV-viewable read density data, visualized as peaks. Browser Extensible Data (BED) files contain the subset of significant (p < 0.05), TSS distal, H3K27Ac overlapping peaks.
