!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = One (histone ChIP) or three (transcription factor ChIP) 2 mm2 frozen cores were pulverized using the Covaris CryoPrep system. Tissue was fixed using 1% formaldehyde and chromatin sheared to 300-500 bp in size using the Covaris E220 ultrasonicator. Resulting chromatin was incubated overnight with indicated antibodies. Purified immunoprecipitates were isolated and quantified by Qubit fluorometer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the ThruPLEX-FD Prep kit (Rubicon Genomics). Libraries were sequenced using 75-bp reads on the Illumina platform at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
