!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For ChIP-exo, T4 DNA polymerase, T4 PNK, and Klenow DNA Polymerase were used together for end polishing. The ligation step was performed with less reducing agent. Protein A Dynal magnetic beads were washed using modified RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCL pH 7.8, 1mM EDTA, 0.25% Na Deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5M LiCl). The library was amplified with only 10 or 12 PCR cycles, and prepared without gel-based size selection. For RNA-seq, the library preparation was performed with NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA molecules were amplified by 8 cycles of PCR. Non-size selection libraries were then sequenced for using Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the OSUCCC sequencing core.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For ChIP-exo, T4 DNA polymerase, T4 PNK, and Klenow DNA Polymerase were used together for end polishing. The ligation step was performed with less reducing agent. Protein A Dynal magnetic beads were washed using modified RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCL pH 7.8, 1mM EDTA, 0.25% Na Deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5M LiCl). The library was amplified with only 10 or 12 PCR cycles, and prepared without gel-based size selection. For RNA-seq, the library preparation was performed with NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA molecules were amplified by 8 cycles of PCR. Non-size selection libraries were then sequenced for using Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the OSUCCC sequencing core.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For ChIP-exo, T4 DNA polymerase, T4 PNK, and Klenow DNA Polymerase were used together for end polishing. The ligation step was performed with less reducing agent. Protein A Dynal magnetic beads were washed using modified RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCL pH 7.8, 1mM EDTA, 0.25% Na Deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5M LiCl). The library was amplified with only 10 or 12 PCR cycles, and prepared without gel-based size selection. For RNA-seq, the library preparation was performed with NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA molecules were amplified by 8 cycles of PCR. Non-size selection libraries were then sequenced for using Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the OSUCCC sequencing core.

Protein A Dynal magnetic beads were washed using modified RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCL pH 7.8, 1mM EDTA, 0.25% Na Deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5M LiCl). The library was amplified with only 10 or 12 PCR cycles, and prepared without gel-based size selection. For RNA-seq, the library preparation was performed with NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA molecules were amplified by 8 cycles of PCR. Non-size selection libraries were then sequenced for using Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the OSUCCC sequencing core.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 50,000 cells were resuspended in cold ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl2). Cell nuclei were then prepared by incubation in 50 μl of ATAC-seq resuspendsion buffer containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin on ice for 3 min. After centrifugation, nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of transposition mix (25 μl 2× TD buffer ,2.5 μl Nextera Tn5 transposase (Illuminar), 16.5 μl PBS, 0.5 μl 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl 10% Tween-20, and 5 μl water), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a thermomixer with shaking at 1,000 rpm. Transposed fragments were then purified with a Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit. All libraries showed sufficient amplification after the 5 pre-amplification cycles and quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit.
