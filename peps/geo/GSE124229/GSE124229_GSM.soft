TN5 transposase was added to the buffer solution (Nextera DNA-library preparation kit, Illumina, Cat# FC-121-1030) and incubated at 370 C for 30 min. After the incubation, the transposed DNA fragments were extracted from the reaction solution using the Mini Elute PCR purification kit (Qiagen Cat# 28004) and then amplified by a 12-cycle PCR amplification step with specific primers
