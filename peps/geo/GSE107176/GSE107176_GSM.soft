!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150cm plates and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich cat# 252549) added directly to culture media for 15min shaking gently at RT. During crosslinking, 1.25M glycine solution (10X) was prepared, then added to plates at a final concentration of 0.125M for 5min shaking gently at RT. The supernatant was aspirated, cells washed 1x with PBS, and harvested on ice using cell scrapers into 15ml sonication tubes (Diagenode cat# C01020031). Cells were pelleted at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 1x with 10ml cold PBS, and pelleted once more. Cell pellet was resuspended in 1.3ml cold ChIP Buffer (2 volumes of SDS ChIP Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS] with 1 volume TXT ChIP Buffer [100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5% Triton X-100]). Cells were then sonicated on a Bioruptor Pico at 4°C for 10min of 30’’ ON-OFF cycles. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15min at 4°C and supernatant transferred to a new 1.5ml microtube. To check sonication efficiency, 20µl of sonicated samples was transferred to a new microtube with 80µl PBS and incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm to decrosslink. DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 30µl H2O. 6µl of orange DNA dye was added and 12µl and 24µl of each sample were run in a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 15min and imaged on a Bio-rad ChemiDoc XRS+. Protein concentration in sonicated samples was measured by Bradford assay, and 200µg of total protein was transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf cat# 0030108051) and brought up to 500µl final volume with ChIP buffer. 5µl was removed as input material (1%) and placed in a separate microtube at 4°C. 2µg antibody was used for each histone ChIP (see Key Resources table for list of antibodies). The samples were rotated end-to-end overnight at 4°C. Protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare cat# 17528001) were washed 3x with ChIP buffer and 30µl bead slurry was added to each sample. Samples were incubated with beads for 2hr at 4°C rotating end-to-end. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 2x with ChIP Low Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x with ChIP High Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors). Beads were dried after the last wash with a 28G needle fitted to a 1ml syringe. Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M sodium carbonate) was prepared fresh before use and 110µl was added to each sample and 95µl to each input sample that was previously set aside. To elute immunocomplexes from beads, samples were incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm. Tubes were centrifuged for 3min at 2000rpm at RT and 100µl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, being careful not to aspirate beads. DNA purification was performed with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 60µl H2O and quantified by Qubit.

The culture medium was changed daily and colonies were enzymatically passaged with StemPro Accutaste cell dissociation reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat# A1110501) at a 1:4-1:6 split ratio every 4-7 days. DMEM/F-12 media (STEMCELL Technologies cat# 36254) was used to detach colonies. ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (STEMCELL Technologies cat# 72302) was used in every split and when cells were thawed from liquid nitrogen. If identified, spontaneously differentiated cells were mechanically removed prior to passaging.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150cm plates and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich cat# 252549) added directly to culture media for 15min shaking gently at RT. During crosslinking, 1.25M glycine solution (10X) was prepared, then added to plates at a final concentration of 0.125M for 5min shaking gently at RT. The supernatant was aspirated, cells washed 1x with PBS, and harvested on ice using cell scrapers into 15ml sonication tubes (Diagenode cat# C01020031). Cells were pelleted at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 1x with 10ml cold PBS, and pelleted once more. Cell pellet was resuspended in 1.3ml cold ChIP Buffer (2 volumes of SDS ChIP Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS] with 1 volume TXT ChIP Buffer [100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5% Triton X-100]). Cells were then sonicated on a Bioruptor Pico at 4°C for 10min of 30’’ ON-OFF cycles. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15min at 4°C and supernatant transferred to a new 1.5ml microtube. To check sonication efficiency, 20µl of sonicated samples was transferred to a new microtube with 80µl PBS and incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm to decrosslink. DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 30µl H2O. 6µl of orange DNA dye was added and 12µl and 24µl of each sample were run in a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 15min and imaged on a Bio-rad ChemiDoc XRS+. Protein concentration in sonicated samples was measured by Bradford assay, and 200µg of total protein was transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf cat# 0030108051) and brought up to 500µl final volume with ChIP buffer. 5µl was removed as input material (1%) and placed in a separate microtube at 4°C. 2µg antibody was used for each histone ChIP (see Key Resources table for list of antibodies). The samples were rotated end-to-end overnight at 4°C. Protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare cat# 17528001) were washed 3x with ChIP buffer and 30µl bead slurry was added to each sample. Samples were incubated with beads for 2hr at 4°C rotating end-to-end. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 2x with ChIP Low Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x with ChIP High Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors). Beads were dried after the last wash with a 28G needle fitted to a 1ml syringe. Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M sodium carbonate) was prepared fresh before use and 110µl was added to each sample and 95µl to each input sample that was previously set aside. To elute immunocomplexes from beads, samples were incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm. Tubes were centrifuged for 3min at 2000rpm at RT and 100µl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, being careful not to aspirate beads. DNA purification was performed with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 60µl H2O and quantified by Qubit.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150cm plates and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich cat# 252549) added directly to culture media for 15min shaking gently at RT. During crosslinking, 1.25M glycine solution (10X) was prepared, then added to plates at a final concentration of 0.125M for 5min shaking gently at RT. The supernatant was aspirated, cells washed 1x with PBS, and harvested on ice using cell scrapers into 15ml sonication tubes (Diagenode cat# C01020031). Cells were pelleted at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 1x with 10ml cold PBS, and pelleted once more. Cell pellet was resuspended in 1.3ml cold ChIP Buffer (2 volumes of SDS ChIP Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS] with 1 volume TXT ChIP Buffer [100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5% Triton X-100]). Cells were then sonicated on a Bioruptor Pico at 4°C for 20min of 30’’ ON-OFF cycles. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15min at 4°C and supernatant transferred to a new 1.5ml microtube. To check sonication efficiency, 20µl of sonicated samples was transferred to a new microtube with 80µl PBS and incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm to decrosslink. DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 30µl H2O. 6µl of orange DNA dye was added and 12µl and 24µl of each sample were run in a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 15min and imaged on a Bio-rad ChemiDoc XRS+. Protein concentration in sonicated samples was measured by Bradford assay, and 200µg of total protein was transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf cat# 0030108051) and brought up to 500µl final volume with ChIP buffer. 5µl was removed as input material (1%) and placed in a separate microtube at 4°C. 2µg antibody was used for each histone ChIP (see Key Resources table for list of antibodies). The samples were rotated end-to-end overnight at 4°C. Protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare cat# 17528001) were washed 3x with ChIP buffer and 30µl bead slurry was added to each sample. Samples were incubated with beads for 2hr at 4°C rotating end-to-end. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 2x with ChIP Low Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x with ChIP High Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors). Beads were dried after the last wash with a 28G needle fitted to a 1ml syringe. Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M sodium carbonate) was prepared fresh before use and 110µl was added to each sample and 95µl to each input sample that was previously set aside. To elute immunocomplexes from beads, samples were incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm. Tubes were centrifuged for 3min at 2000rpm at RT and 100µl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, being careful not to aspirate beads. DNA purification was performed with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 60µl H2O and quantified by Qubit.

Complete culture media comprised of DMEM/Ham’s F-12 (1:1) that was supplemented with 5% horse serum, 10ng/ml EGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat# PHG0311), 50ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich cat# C8052), 10μg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich cat# 91077C), 500ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich cat# H0888), 1x penicillin/streptomycin, and 1x glutamax.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150cm plates and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich cat# 252549) added directly to culture media for 15min shaking gently at RT. During crosslinking, 1.25M glycine solution (10X) was prepared, then added to plates at a final concentration of 0.125M for 5min shaking gently at RT. The supernatant was aspirated, cells washed 1x with PBS, and harvested on ice using cell scrapers into 15ml sonication tubes (Diagenode cat# C01020031). Cells were pelleted at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 1x with 10ml cold PBS, and pelleted once more. Cell pellet was resuspended in 1.3ml cold ChIP Buffer (2 volumes of SDS ChIP Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS] with 1 volume TXT ChIP Buffer [100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5% Triton X-100]). Cells were then sonicated on a Bioruptor Pico at 4°C for 20min of 30’’ ON-OFF cycles. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15min at 4°C and supernatant transferred to a new 1.5ml microtube. To check sonication efficiency, 20µl of sonicated samples was transferred to a new microtube with 80µl PBS and incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm to decrosslink. DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 30µl H2O. 6µl of orange DNA dye was added and 12µl and 24µl of each sample were run in a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 15min and imaged on a Bio-rad ChemiDoc XRS+. Protein concentration in sonicated samples was measured by Bradford assay, and 200µg of total protein was transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf cat# 0030108051) and brought up to 500µl final volume with ChIP buffer. 5µl was removed as input material (1%) and placed in a separate microtube at 4°C. 2µg antibody was used for each histone ChIP (see Key Resources table for list of antibodies). The samples were rotated end-to-end overnight at 4°C. Protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare cat# 17528001) were washed 3x with ChIP buffer and 30µl bead slurry was added to each sample. Samples were incubated with beads for 2hr at 4°C rotating end-to-end. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 2x with ChIP Low Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x with ChIP High Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors). Beads were dried after the last wash with a 28G needle fitted to a 1ml syringe. Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M sodium carbonate) was prepared fresh before use and 110µl was added to each sample and 95µl to each input sample that was previously set aside. To elute immunocomplexes from beads, samples were incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm. Tubes were centrifuged for 3min at 2000rpm at RT and 100µl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, being careful not to aspirate beads. DNA purification was performed with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 60µl H2O and quantified by Qubit.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150cm plates and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich cat# 252549) added directly to culture media for 15min shaking gently at RT. During crosslinking, 1.25M glycine solution (10X) was prepared, then added to plates at a final concentration of 0.125M for 5min shaking gently at RT. The supernatant was aspirated, cells washed 1x with PBS, and harvested on ice using cell scrapers into 15ml sonication tubes (Diagenode cat# C01020031). Cells were pelleted at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 1x with 10ml cold PBS, and pelleted once more. Cell pellet was resuspended in 1.3ml cold ChIP Buffer (2 volumes of SDS ChIP Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS] with 1 volume TXT ChIP Buffer [100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5% Triton X-100]). Cells were then sonicated on a Bioruptor Pico at 4°C for 20min of 30’’ ON-OFF cycles. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15min at 4°C and supernatant transferred to a new 1.5ml microtube. To check sonication efficiency, 20µl of sonicated samples was transferred to a new microtube with 80µl PBS and incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm to decrosslink. DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 30µl H2O. 6µl of orange DNA dye was added and 12µl and 24µl of each sample were run in a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 15min and imaged on a Bio-rad ChemiDoc XRS+. Protein concentration in sonicated samples was measured by Bradford assay, and 200µg of total protein was transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf cat# 0030108051) and brought up to 500µl final volume with ChIP buffer. 5µl was removed as input material (1%) and placed in a separate microtube at 4°C. 2µg antibody was used for each histone ChIP (see Key Resources table for list of antibodies). The samples were rotated end-to-end overnight at 4°C. Protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare cat# 17528001) were washed 3x with ChIP buffer and 30µl bead slurry was added to each sample. Samples were incubated with beads for 2hr at 4°C rotating end-to-end. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 2x with ChIP Low Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x with ChIP High Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors). Beads were dried after the last wash with a 28G needle fitted to a 1ml syringe. Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M sodium carbonate) was prepared fresh before use and 110µl was added to each sample and 95µl to each input sample that was previously set aside. To elute immunocomplexes from beads, samples were incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm. Tubes were centrifuged for 3min at 2000rpm at RT and 100µl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, being careful not to aspirate beads. DNA purification was performed with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 60µl H2O and quantified by Qubit.

!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150cm plates and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich cat# 252549) added directly to culture media for 15min shaking gently at RT. During crosslinking, 1.25M glycine solution (10X) was prepared, then added to plates at a final concentration of 0.125M for 5min shaking gently at RT. The supernatant was aspirated, cells washed 1x with PBS, and harvested on ice using cell scrapers into 15ml sonication tubes (Diagenode cat# C01020031). Cells were pelleted at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 1x with 10ml cold PBS, and pelleted once more. Cell pellet was resuspended in 1.3ml cold ChIP Buffer (2 volumes of SDS ChIP Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS] with 1 volume TXT ChIP Buffer [100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5% Triton X-100]). Cells were then sonicated on a Bioruptor Pico at 4°C for 20min of 30’’ ON-OFF cycles. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15min at 4°C and supernatant transferred to a new 1.5ml microtube. To check sonication efficiency, 20µl of sonicated samples was transferred to a new microtube with 80µl PBS and incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm to decrosslink. DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 30µl H2O. 6µl of orange DNA dye was added and 12µl and 24µl of each sample were run in a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 15min and imaged on a Bio-rad ChemiDoc XRS+. Protein concentration in sonicated samples was measured by Bradford assay, and 200µg of total protein was transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf cat# 0030108051) and brought up to 500µl final volume with ChIP buffer. 5µl was removed as input material (1%) and placed in a separate microtube at 4°C. 2µg antibody was used for each histone ChIP (see Key Resources table for list of antibodies). The samples were rotated end-to-end overnight at 4°C. Protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare cat# 17528001) were washed 3x with ChIP buffer and 30µl bead slurry was added to each sample. Samples were incubated with beads for 2hr at 4°C rotating end-to-end. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 2x with ChIP Low Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x with ChIP High Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors). Beads were dried after the last wash with a 28G needle fitted to a 1ml syringe. Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M sodium carbonate) was prepared fresh before use and 110µl was added to each sample and 95µl to each input sample that was previously set aside. To elute immunocomplexes from beads, samples were incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm. Tubes were centrifuged for 3min at 2000rpm at RT and 100µl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, being careful not to aspirate beads. DNA purification was performed with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 60µl H2O and quantified by Qubit.

Cells were pelleted at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 1x with 10ml cold PBS, and pelleted once more. Cell pellet was resuspended in 1.3ml cold ChIP Buffer (2 volumes of SDS ChIP Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS] with 1 volume TXT ChIP Buffer [100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5% Triton X-100]). Cells were then sonicated on a Bioruptor Pico at 4°C for 20min of 30’’ ON-OFF cycles. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15min at 4°C and supernatant transferred to a new 1.5ml microtube. To check sonication efficiency, 20µl of sonicated samples was transferred to a new microtube with 80µl PBS and incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm to decrosslink. DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 30µl H2O. 6µl of orange DNA dye was added and 12µl and 24µl of each sample were run in a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 15min and imaged on a Bio-rad ChemiDoc XRS+. Protein concentration in sonicated samples was measured by Bradford assay, and 200µg of total protein was transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf cat# 0030108051) and brought up to 500µl final volume with ChIP buffer. 5µl was removed as input material (1%) and placed in a separate microtube at 4°C. 2µg antibody was used for each histone ChIP (see Key Resources table for list of antibodies). The samples were rotated end-to-end overnight at 4°C. Protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare cat# 17528001) were washed 3x with ChIP buffer and 30µl bead slurry was added to each sample. Samples were incubated with beads for 2hr at 4°C rotating end-to-end. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 2x with ChIP Low Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x with ChIP High Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors). Beads were dried after the last wash with a 28G needle fitted to a 1ml syringe. Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M sodium carbonate) was prepared fresh before use and 110µl was added to each sample and 95µl to each input sample that was previously set aside. To elute immunocomplexes from beads, samples were incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm. Tubes were centrifuged for 3min at 2000rpm at RT and 100µl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, being careful not to aspirate beads. DNA purification was performed with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 60µl H2O and quantified by Qubit.

!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = ATAC-seq experiments were performed as previously described (Buenrostro et al., 2013) with the following modifications: 25,000 cells for each cell line were used to perform the transposon reaction. Samples were purified with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup kit (Qiagen cat# 28206) and DNA eluted in 13μl of EB Buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = To calculate the number of cycles for library amplification, 2μl of transposed DNA were amplified by qPCR for a total of 25 cycles. The 10μl qPCR reaction was set up as follows: 2μl of transposed DNA, 0.3μl 25μM Ad1_noMX, 0.3μl 25μM Ad2.X (custom oligos synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies), 5μl NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (New England BioLabs, #M0541S), 0.1μl 100X SYBR Green I (10,000X stock from Invitrogen, #S7563) and 2.3μl nuclease-free water with the following program on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Optics Module Thermal Cycler machine: 1) 72°C for 5 minutes, 2) 98°C for 30 seconds, 3) 98°C for 10 seconds, 63°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds, 25 cycles, 4) 72°C for 1 minute, and 5) hold at 10°C. The Ct value of each sample reflects the number of PCR cycles for optimal amplification in the linear range of the reaction. A 50ul PCR reaction was then set up as follows: 10μl transposed DNA, 1.5μl 25μM Ad1_noMX, 1.5 μl 25μM Ad2.X (unique for each sample), 12μl of nuclease free water, and 25μl NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix with the same program as for the qPCR, but substituting the cycle number with the Ct-value obtained from the qPCR reaction. The PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. After PCR, the 50μl reactions were cleaned up and size selected by adding 25 μl of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter #A63881) to remove fragments higher than 800bp. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 65μl of AMPure XP beads were added to remove fragments smaller than 100bp, then washed twice with freshly prepared 80% ethanol and eluted in 25μl of water. To determine the average fragment size of each library, samples were run through a High-sensitivity DNA screentape (Agilent Technologies cat# 5067-5584) following the manufacturer’s instructions on an Agilent Technologies 2200 TapeStation machine. To determine the concentration of each library, Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat# Q32851) were used following the manufacturer’s instructions on a Qubit 3 fluorometer.

!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = ATAC-seq experiments were performed as previously described (Buenrostro et al., 2013) with the following modifications: 25,000 cells for each cell line were used to perform the transposon reaction. Samples were purified with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup kit (Qiagen cat# 28206) and DNA eluted in 13μl of EB Buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = To calculate the number of cycles for library amplification, 2μl of transposed DNA were amplified by qPCR for a total of 25 cycles. The 10μl qPCR reaction was set up as follows: 2μl of transposed DNA, 0.3μl 25μM Ad1_noMX, 0.3μl 25μM Ad2.X (custom oligos synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies), 5μl NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (New England BioLabs, #M0541S), 0.1μl 100X SYBR Green I (10,000X stock from Invitrogen, #S7563) and 2.3μl nuclease-free water with the following program on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Optics Module Thermal Cycler machine: 1) 72°C for 5 minutes, 2) 98°C for 30 seconds, 3) 98°C for 10 seconds, 63°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds, 25 cycles, 4) 72°C for 1 minute, and 5) hold at 10°C. The Ct value of each sample reflects the number of PCR cycles for optimal amplification in the linear range of the reaction. A 50ul PCR reaction was then set up as follows: 10μl transposed DNA, 1.5μl 25μM Ad1_noMX, 1.5 μl 25μM Ad2.X (unique for each sample), 12μl of nuclease free water, and 25μl NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix with the same program as for the qPCR, but substituting the cycle number with the Ct-value obtained from the qPCR reaction. The PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. After PCR, the 50μl reactions were cleaned up and size selected by adding 25 μl of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter #A63881) to remove fragments higher than 800bp. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 65μl of AMPure XP beads were added to remove fragments smaller than 100bp, then washed twice with freshly prepared 80% ethanol and eluted in 25μl of water. To determine the average fragment size of each library, samples were run through a High-sensitivity DNA screentape (Agilent Technologies cat# 5067-5584) following the manufacturer’s instructions on an Agilent Technologies 2200 TapeStation machine. To determine the concentration of each library, Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat# Q32851) were used following the manufacturer’s instructions on a Qubit 3 fluorometer.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150cm plates and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich cat# 252549) added directly to culture media for 15min shaking gently at RT. During crosslinking, 1.25M glycine solution (10X) was prepared, then added to plates at a final concentration of 0.125M for 5min shaking gently at RT. The supernatant was aspirated, cells washed 1x with PBS, and harvested on ice using cell scrapers into 15ml sonication tubes (Diagenode cat# C01020031). Cells were pelleted at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 1x with 10ml cold PBS, and pelleted once more. Cell pellet was resuspended in 1.3ml cold ChIP Buffer (2 volumes of SDS ChIP Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS] with 1 volume TXT ChIP Buffer [100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5% Triton X-100]). Cells were then sonicated on a Bioruptor Pico at 4°C for 20min of 30’’ ON-OFF cycles. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15min at 4°C and supernatant transferred to a new 1.5ml microtube. To check sonication efficiency, 20µl of sonicated samples was transferred to a new microtube with 80µl PBS and incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm to decrosslink. DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 30µl H2O. 6µl of orange DNA dye was added and 12µl and 24µl of each sample were run in a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 15min and imaged on a Bio-rad ChemiDoc XRS+. Protein concentration in sonicated samples was measured by Bradford assay, and 200µg of total protein was transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf cat# 0030108051) and brought up to 500µl final volume with ChIP buffer. 5µl was removed as input material (1%) and placed in a separate microtube at 4°C. 2µg antibody was used for each histone ChIP (see Key Resources table for list of antibodies). The samples were rotated end-to-end overnight at 4°C. Protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare cat# 17528001) were washed 3x with ChIP buffer and 30µl bead slurry was added to each sample. Samples were incubated with beads for 2hr at 4°C rotating end-to-end. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 2000rpm for 3min at 4°C, washed 2x with ChIP Low Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x with ChIP High Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors). Beads were dried after the last wash with a 28G needle fitted to a 1ml syringe. Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M sodium carbonate) was prepared fresh before use and 110µl was added to each sample and 95µl to each input sample that was previously set aside. To elute immunocomplexes from beads, samples were incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm. Tubes were centrifuged for 3min at 2000rpm at RT and 100µl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, being careful not to aspirate beads. DNA purification was performed with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat# 28106) and eluted in 60µl H2O and quantified by Qubit.

!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = ATAC-seq experiments were performed as previously described (Buenrostro et al., 2013) with the following modifications: 25,000 cells for each cell line were used to perform the transposon reaction. Samples were purified with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup kit (Qiagen cat# 28206) and DNA eluted in 13μl of EB Buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = To calculate the number of cycles for library amplification, 2μl of transposed DNA were amplified by qPCR for a total of 25 cycles. The 10μl qPCR reaction was set up as follows: 2μl of transposed DNA, 0.3μl 25μM Ad1_noMX, 0.3μl 25μM Ad2.X (custom oligos synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies), 5μl NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (New England BioLabs, #M0541S), 0.1μl 100X SYBR Green I (10,000X stock from Invitrogen, #S7563) and 2.3μl nuclease-free water with the following program on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Optics Module Thermal Cycler machine: 1) 72°C for 5 minutes, 2) 98°C for 30 seconds, 3) 98°C for 10 seconds, 63°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds, 25 cycles, 4) 72°C for 1 minute, and 5) hold at 10°C. The Ct value of each sample reflects the number of PCR cycles for optimal amplification in the linear range of the reaction. A 50ul PCR reaction was then set up as follows: 10μl transposed DNA, 1.5μl 25μM Ad1_noMX, 1.5 μl 25μM Ad2.X (unique for each sample), 12μl of nuclease free water, and 25μl NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix with the same program as for the qPCR, but substituting the cycle number with the Ct-value obtained from the qPCR reaction. The PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. After PCR, the 50μl reactions were cleaned up and size selected by adding 25 μl of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter #A63881) to remove fragments higher than 800bp. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 65μl of AMPure XP beads were added to remove fragments smaller than 100bp, then washed twice with freshly prepared 80% ethanol and eluted in 25μl of water. To determine the average fragment size of each library, samples were run through a High-sensitivity DNA screentape (Agilent Technologies cat# 5067-5584) following the manufacturer’s instructions on an Agilent Technologies 2200 TapeStation machine. To determine the concentration of each library, Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat# Q32851) were used following the manufacturer’s instructions on a Qubit 3 fluorometer.
!Sample_data_processing = FASTQ data  were processed with Trimmomatic v0.32 to remove adapters and low-quality reads.

A 50ul PCR reaction was then set up as follows: 10μl transposed DNA, 1.5μl 25μM Ad1_noMX, 1.5 μl 25μM Ad2.X (unique for each sample), 12μl of nuclease free water, and 25μl NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix with the same program as for the qPCR, but substituting the cycle number with the Ct-value obtained from the qPCR reaction. The PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. After PCR, the 50μl reactions were cleaned up and size selected by adding 25 μl of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter #A63881) to remove fragments higher than 800bp. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 65μl of AMPure XP beads were added to remove fragments smaller than 100bp, then washed twice with freshly prepared 80% ethanol and eluted in 25μl of water. To determine the average fragment size of each library, samples were run through a High-sensitivity DNA screentape (Agilent Technologies cat# 5067-5584) following the manufacturer’s instructions on an Agilent Technologies 2200 TapeStation machine. To determine the concentration of each library, Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat# Q32851) were used following the manufacturer’s instructions on a Qubit 3 fluorometer.
!Sample_data_processing = FASTQ data  were processed with Trimmomatic v0.32 to remove adapters and low-quality reads.
